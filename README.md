> # CRITTER

A twitter clone produced as part of the Concordia Bootcamps Full-Stack Web Development program. I believe this was a bit of a very early intro to RESTful APIs ... we got started on this one 40 days in to the program. Scarcely a loading spinner to be found in this one, but I got there eventually ;)
